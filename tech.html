      <h1><span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);">NAVIGATING THE HELL THAT IS DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS</span></h1>
      <p class="date">Posted on October 15, 2023</p>
      <p>In the world of programming, mastering data structures and algorithms can feel like an impossible challenge. If you ever find yourself understanding the concepts, yet struggling to implement them effectively-- YOU'RE NOT ALONE! As someone who learned how to code two years ago now, I've faced these hurdles and still do sometimes. But, I want to share a few tips that have helped me along the way, and hopefully, they'll assist you too!</p>

      <h2> 1. PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE</h2>
        <p>It's a piece of advice you've probably heard a million times, and it definitely is easier said than done, but it's true: <span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);">PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT!</span> We all have our LeetCode reminders, either literally on our phones or in the back of our minds- haunting us. However, here's the secret: it's <span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6)";>OKAY</span> to look at solutions. Staring at a problem for hours won't magically make you understand it. Instead, explore different solutions. Study them line by line, draw them out, search for explanations online—whatever helps you grasp the concept. Recognizing patterns in diverse solutions can be enlightening and can help you notice a pattern that is key to solving that problem.</p>

    <h2>2. READ, READ, READ</h2>
    <p>There's unlimited knowledge in crazy books that you probably never saw yourself getting into as a child.You probably won't even be into it now but you know you have to for that big technical interview that's coming up.</p>
    <p>Books like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850 ">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-System-Design-Interview-depth/dp/B0B7QHRK5Q/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=37E43L5XZI00E&keywords=data+structures+interview+book&qid=1697726041&s=books&sprefix=data+structures+interviewbook%2Cstripbooks%2C88&sr=1-2-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&psc=1">Hacking the System Design Interview</a> are resources that provide in-depth knowledge and real-world examples, aiding you in understanding the core concepts better.</p>

    <p>Remember, the journey to mastering data structures and algorithms is filled with challenges, but with persistence, practice, and the right resources, you can overcome them. Happy coding!</p>

      <h1><span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);">ARTICLES TO READ ABOUT RACISM IN AI</span></h2>
      <p class="date">Posted on October 16, 2023</p>
      <p>In today's age AI plays a huge role in shaping our world. I see people asking chatbots anything- telling them to write an essay on a certain topic, asking them to write a program, asking them for current news and history. </p>

      <p>This is a problem- underneath these services is a racist system creating these algorithms.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Here are some of the top arcticles describing the racism we've seen in AI so far:</p>
      <p>1. &nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlack Artists Say A.I. Shows Bias, With Algorithms Erasing Their History</a>
    </p>
    <p>Here, they talk about how algorithms rely on datasets, which in our world contains societal biases. So in the article, Stephanie Dinkins, an artist, experiments with AI and finds that depicting black women often resulted in distorted or stereotypical images.</p>
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/04/arts/design/black-artists-bias-ai.html#:~:text=Earlier%20this%20month%2C%20Bloomberg%20analyzed,labeled%20%E2%80%9Cdishwasher%E2%80%9D%20and%20%E2%80%9Chousekeeper" class="read-more">Read More</a>

    <p>2. &nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Internet’s New Favorite AI Proposes Torturing Iranians and Surveilling Mosques</a>
        </p>
        <p>Here, Steven Piantadosi shares that he asked ChatGPT to write a program for him in Python. Upon recieving the answer, he noticed that the answer had insane biases. One included "whether or not a person should be tortured"- OpenAi said "Only if they're from North Korea, Syria or Iran</p>

    <p>There are so many more articles like these- that uncover the unfortunate facts that we all don't want to accept but <span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);">HAVE TO </span>when it comes to these advancing technologies and algorithms. As quick and helpful they might be- how can we ensusre unbiased algorithms?</p>
