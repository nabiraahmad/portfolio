      <h2>How many of you know what is going in Gaza?</h2>

      <p>If your answer is that this <span style="font-style: italic">"conflict"</span> is <span style="font-style: italic"> "complex"</span>, maybe you don't know what's going on.</p>

      <p>And I'm not here to tell you what's going on- that isn't my job, and it's entirely up to you if you want to be more aware of what's going on and <span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);"> RESEARCH.</span></p>

      <p>U.S. media is failing you. I just checked my email on October 18 and recieved an email from NYT on the Hamas attack on Israel.. Something that was a week ago- meanwhile after that attack Israel has been wiping Palestinians off the map with the rate that they're bombing people.</p>

      <h2>DIFFERENCE IN LANGUAGE</h2>
        <p>When talking about the attack on Israel- I hear so many people describing it using words like "innocent", "children", "brutal", "deadly", "horrific", etc. When talking about the attacks on Gaza it's a "conflict", "defense tactic", or "disagreement".</p>
        <p>Like what is this hypocrisy?</p>

        <h2>Are palestinian lives not innocent?</h2>

        <p>It's all a foreign relations thing. America didn't support Ukraine because America cared about Ukrainians. America supported them because their relations with Russia are - ironically "complex".</p>

        <p>Either way, the growth of islamaphobia is insane. How is the Israeli prime minister allowed to refer to Palestinians as being from darkness? or from a jungle?</p>
