      <h1><span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);">TOP TIPS EVERY BEGINNER POWERLIFTER SHOULD KNOW</span></h1>
      <p class="date">Posted on October 10, 2023</p>
      <p>When you think of powerlifters do you think of huge jacked men in singlets with what it looks like-hands covered in cocaine?</p>

      <p>I used to think like that too- but believe me it's not like that anymore. There are so many diverse powerlifters that honestly helped me get into powerlifting, since I was always so intimidated by those big ass scary men!</p>

      <p>So if you want to start powerlifting, here's some of the advice I've learned in the past two years:</p>
      <h2> 1. FOCUS ON THE THREE MOVEMENTS</h2>
        <p><span style="color:rgba(255, 0, 255, 0.6);">SQUAT, BENCH, AND DEADLIFT</span> is your holy grail</p>
        <p>I say that because each of your workouts should be centered on one of these movements. Accessory movements are useful but ultimately practice what you're going to be competing in.</p>

        <p>This includes perfecting technique and creating your program after you know your max. Always start your workout (after warm up and stretches) with one of these three movements. Don't fatigue yourself doing isolated movements!</p>

    <h2>2. PLEASE STRETCH .. SERIOUSLY</h2>
    <p>One thing I found out very recently is that if you don't stretch, your form can get lost.</p>
    <p>Apparently how it goes is you don't stretch so you lose mobility and that makes it harder for you to keep good form and technique when increasing weight or reps (intensity) on a lift.</p>

    <p>Yup, that actually makes sense- I know! But seriously if you want to keep powerlifting, you don't want to risk injuries so include dynamic stretching before your workout.</p>

    <h2>3. RECOVERY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THINK</h2>
    <p>Recovery doesn't just mean taking a few days off from the gym once you feel like your body literally cannot hold a dumbell anymore.</p>
    <p>It's more than that- it's your sleep, nutrition, stress level, and supplements.</p>

    <p>Aim for 8 hours of sleep, maintain stress levels, know that it's okay to have a bad lift sometimes, and that it's okay to take off from lifting because your head isn't in the right place!</p>
